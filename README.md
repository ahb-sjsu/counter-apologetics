This repository hosts essays and draft papers exploring logic, mathematics, theism, and apologetics.

## Current contents

- **A Pragmatist Rebuttal to Logical and Metaphysical Arguments for God** (`A Pragmatist Rebuttal to Logical and Metaphysical Arguments for God.pdf`)  
  A detailed response to arguments used by apologists like William Lane Craig:
  - Kalam Cosmological Argument  
  - Contingency Argument  
  - Moral Argument  
  - Ontological Argument  

  The paper:
  - Treats logic and mathematics as **tools** rather than metaphysical mirrors.  
  - Uses **Gödel’s incompleteness theorems** to argue no formal system can guarantee metaphysical conclusions.  
  - Uses **quantum theory** to show that classical logic and causation are domain-limited, not universally binding.  
  - Concludes that these arguments fail as *demonstrations* of God’s existence (without claiming to disprove God).
